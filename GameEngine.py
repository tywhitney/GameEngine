def create_player():
    '''  generate a character based on user input

        This function contains several local functions, each using a different
        method of chaaracter creation:
            simple - the user is asked which stat(str, dex, con, int, wis, cha)
                is most important, and which is least.  most important gets
                a value of 17, least gets a 9, and the rest get 12. This method
                is suitable for a 20-point character build using Pathfinder d20
                rules.  This method has only a few choices, and results in
                moderate satisfaction for the user.
            hardcore - results are generated randomly using the 3d6 method, in
                standard stat block sequence: (str, dex, con, int, wis, cha).
                if none of the stats are over 12, then the entire set is re-
                rolled until it does. The user has no control over ability
                scores. This method is the easiest, but usually has the least
                satisfaction for the user.
            4d6, keep best three, arrange to suit - 6 sets of 4d6 are rolled,
                in each set, the top three dice are kept and added together.
                Then these scores are assigned by the user. This method usually
                has the highest satisfaction for the player, but is also the
                most complicated, due to the many choices required.'''

                standard stat block sequence: (str, dex, con, int, wis, cha).

                rolled until it does. The user has no control over ability
